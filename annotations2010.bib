  abstract = {The MinneTAC trading agent is designed to compete
  in the Supply-Chain Trading
  Agent Competition. It is also designed to support the needs of a group of
  researchers, each of whom is interested in different decision problems
  related to the competition scenario. The design of MinneTAC breaks
  out each basic behavior into a separate, configurable component, and
  allows dynamic construction of analysis and modeling tools from
  small, single-purpose ``evaluators''.
  The agent is
  defined as a set of ``roles'', and a working agent is one for which a
  component is supplied for each role. This allows each researcher to
  focus on a single problem and work independently, and it allows
  multiple researchers to tackle the same problem in different ways.
  A working MinneTAC agent is
  completely defined by a set of configuration files that map the
  desired roles to the code that implements them, and that set
  parameters for the components.
  We describe the design of
  MinneTAC, and we evaluate its effectiveness in
  support of our research agenda and its competitiveness in the
  TAC-SCM game environment.},

  abstract = {Modern electronic commerce creates significant challenges
                  for decision-makers. The trading agent competition
                  for supply-chain management (TAC SCM) is an annual
                  competition among fully-autonomous trading agents
                  designed by teams around the world. Agents attempt
                  to maximize profits in a supply-chain scenario that
                  requires them to coordinate Procurement, Production,
                  and Sales activities in competitive markets. An
                  agent for TAC SCM is a complex piece of software
                  that must operate in a competitive economic
                  environment. We report on results of an informal
                  survey of agent design approaches among the
                  competitors in TAC SCM, and then we describe and
                  evaluate the design of our MinneTAC trading
                  agent. We focus on the use of evaluators -
                  configurable, composable modules for data analysis,
                  modeling, and prediction that are chained together
                  at runtime to support agent decision-making. Through
                  a set of examples, we show how this structure
                  supports Sales and Procurement decisions, and how
                  those decision process can be modified in useful
                  ways by changing evaluator configurations.},
