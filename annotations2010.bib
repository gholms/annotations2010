  abstract = {The MinneTAC trading agent is designed to compete
  in the Supply-Chain Trading
  Agent Competition. It is also designed to support the needs of a group of
  researchers, each of whom is interested in different decision problems
  related to the competition scenario. The design of MinneTAC breaks
  out each basic behavior into a separate, configurable component, and
  allows dynamic construction of analysis and modeling tools from
  small, single-purpose ``evaluators''.
  The agent is
  defined as a set of ``roles'', and a working agent is one for which a
  component is supplied for each role. This allows each researcher to
  focus on a single problem and work independently, and it allows
  multiple researchers to tackle the same problem in different ways.
  A working MinneTAC agent is
  completely defined by a set of configuration files that map the
  desired roles to the code that implements them, and that set
  parameters for the components.
  We describe the design of
  MinneTAC, and we evaluate its effectiveness in
  support of our research agenda and its competitiveness in the
  TAC-SCM game environment.},
